Data Types and Operations | Questions

Please answer all of the following questions thoughtfully and completely.


1a - What is the resulting type of two integers used together for an operation, like 5 + 4?
The result would be the answer, 8.


1b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?


2a - What is the resulting type of an integer and a float used together for an operation, like -11.4 - 5?
It would result as a float.


2b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?



3a - What is the resulting type of two floats used together for an operation, like 2.3 * .45?
It would result as a float.


3b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?



4 - What is string concatenation? How does it work?
String concatenation is when you combine strings. For ex. print('red ' + 'folder ') and that would result in red folder in the console. 


5 - What is string duplication? How does it work?
String duplication is when strings are duplicated or repeated by using multiplication. For ex. print('blue' * 2) and that would result as blueblue in the console.


6 - Can you combine strings and integers? What about strings and floats? What happens if you do?
Yes you can combine strings and intergers hence string duplication. You cannot combine strings and floats because 


7 - What does this tell you about how strings can interact with integers or floats?



8 - Can you use one of the operators to determine if a number is even or odd?
